# Password Complexity Checker

This Python-based tool assesses the strength of a given password based on multiple criteria: length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback on whether the password is weak, moderate, strong, or very strong.

## Features

- **Length Check:** Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long (ideally 12 or more).
- **Uppercase and Lowercase Letters:** Validates that the password contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Numbers:** Checks for at least one numeric character.
- **Special Characters:** Verifies that the password includes at least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`).
- **Feedback:** Gives feedback on the strength of the password.
